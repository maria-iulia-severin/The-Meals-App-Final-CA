2,Split pea & green pea smoked ham soup,23,0,0,"Put the gammon in a very large pan with 2 litres water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and drain off the water – this helps to get rid of some of the saltiness. Recover with 2 litres cold water and bring to the boil again. Put everything but the frozen peas into the pan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1½-2½ hrs; topping up the water as and when you need to; to a similar level it started at. As the ham cooks and softens; you can halve it if you want; so it is all submerged under the liquid. When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds; it is ready.
Lift out the ham; peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves); shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min; then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick; and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled; or if you are making ahead.
When you are ready to serve; mix the hot soup with most of the ham – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top; and eat with crusty bread and butter.",1,food
2,Scampi with tartare sauce,12.39,0,0,"To prepare the langoustines; pull off the head and pincers. Lay the tail flat on a chopping board and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut a line straight down the back of the shell. Carefully peel the langoustine; score down the back; then remove the grit sac.
Get the oil heating in a large saucepan or wok – you will need enough to come 2-3in up the side of the pan. For the tartare sauce; mix all ingredients in a bowl and season.
Place the flours in a bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the beer and sparkling water; and whisk to a smooth batter.
To test if the oil is hot enough; put a drop of batter into the pan – it should crisp and brown within 30 secs. Dip each langoustine or prawn tail into the batter; then carefully drop it into the oil. Drizzle a little extra batter over each one while they are cooking – this will give you a really crispy coating. Cook them in batches; making sure you don’t overcrowd the pan. When golden and floating to the surface; scoop out and drain well on kitchen paper. Sprinkle the scampi with salt and serve with the tartare sauce; lemon wedges and chips.

4,Salt & pepper tofu,15.2,0,0,"Drain the tofu; wrap loosely in kitchen paper and put on a plate. Rest a chopping board on top. If you’re using a light chopping board; weigh it down with a couple of cans – a heavier chopping board will be sufficient on its own. Leave for 10-20 mins until the cloth feels wet from the excess liquid. Pressing the tofu like this helps to give it a firmer texture once cooked.
Cut the tofu in half down the centre like a book. Cut each piece into four triangles; as you would a piece of toast; then in half again to give you 16 pieces in total. Mix the cornflour; ground pepper and 1 tsp flaky sea salt on a plate. Gently turn each piece of tofu in the cornflour mix to coat.

Mix; then knead on your work surface for 10 mins. Shape into a ball; put in a lightly oiled bowl; cover and chill for at least 2 hrs.
Put the butter between 2 sheets of baking parchment. Using a rolling pin; bash and roll it into a rectangle about 20 x 15cm. Leave wrapped in the baking parchment and chill.
Transfer the chilled dough to a floured surface and roll into a 40 x 20cm rectangle. Place the unwrapped slab of butter in the centre of the dough; so that it covers the middle third.
Fold one side of the dough up and halfway over the butter.
Fold the other side of the dough up and over the butter in the same way; so that the two edges of the dough meet in the centre of the butter.
Fold the dough in half so that the point where the ends of the dough meet becomes the seam. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.
Repeat the rolling; folding and chilling process (steps 3-6) twice more in exactly the same way – rolling the pastry while it’s still folded – without adding more butter. Wrap and chill overnight.
The next day; roll the dough out on a floured surface into a large rectangle; measuring about 60 x 30cm. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter; trim the edges to neaten.
Cut the dough in half lengthways so that you have 2 long strips; then cut each strip into 6 or 7 triangles with 2 equal sides.
Take each triangle in turn and pull the two corners at the base to stretch and widen it.
Starting at the base of each triangle; begin to gently roll into a croissant; being careful not to crush the dough.
Continue rolling; making sure the tip of each triangle ends up tucked under the croissant to hold in place. If adding any fillings (see tips; below); place across the widest part of the triangle before rolling up.
Bend the ends of the croissants inwards; then transfer to baking trays lined with baking parchment; spaced well apart. Cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 2 hrs; or until doubled in size.

8,Cannoli,6,0,0,"Tip the flour; sugar; bicarb; cinnamon and cocoa (if using) into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Add the butter and rub it into the dry ingredients until there are no more lumps. Mix the egg yolk and marsala and add this to the bowl; then mix the whole lot together and knead to a smooth dough. Wrap and rest in the fridge. (Can be made ahead and fried the next day.)
Fill a deep-fat fryer; wok or deep saucepan a third of the way up with oil. Cut the dough into pieces and; working one piece at a time; roll them out as thinly as you can – use a pasta machine if you have one. Heat the oil and keep an eye on it until it reaches 180C. Lay the dough out on a lightly floured surface and cut out circles about 11cm across. Wrap each one around a cannoli mould; using some of the egg white to stick the top edge down and they're ready for frying.
It's important to take care when cooking with hot oil. Read our guide on how to deep-fry safely to avoid accidents in the kitchen.
Deep-fry the cannoli (with their moulds) one at a time; making sure they cook all over. They should take about 45-60 seconds in all and should be visibly golden brown (keep cooking a little longer if they aren't) and the dough will bubble and blister. Carefully take each one out of the oil using the tongs and shake the cannoli off the mould very carefully onto kitchen paper. As you fry each one; make sure the oil stays at 180C at all times and doesn’t get any hotter. These will keep for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
When the cannoli are cold; dip the end of each one into chocolate; then dip some of those into the pistachios. Leave to cool and harden. Beat the ricotta and mascarpone together; then stir in the candied peel and sugar. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag with a wide star nozzle and pipe it into the cannoli. Serve soon after filling.",3,food

10,Day of the Dead biscuits,2,0,0,"To make the dough; tip the butter; flour and a good pinch of salt into a food processor. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs; and the butter is well mixed in. Add the icing sugar; egg yolk and 2 tsp cold water. Blend again until the mixture starts to clump together; add another 1 tsp water if the dough looks too dry; but try to avoid adding any more; as this will make the biscuits tough. Tip the crumbs out onto a work surface and squash everything together to make a ball of dough; you may have to knead it a few times for an even texture. Wrap in cling film; pat into a flat disk and chill for 30 mins.
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 large baking sheets with baking parchment. If the dough is very firm; leave it at room temperature for 10 mins; or until softened a little. Dust your work surface with flour; then unwrap and roll out the dough to the thickness of a £1 coin. Stamp out as many skull shapes as you can; then squash the scraps of dough back together; reroll and stamp out a few more. Arrange the skull shapes over the trays; bake for 18-20 mins; until just golden; swapping the trays over halfway through if your oven cooks unevenly. Leave to cool on the trays for 10 mins; then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
Whilst the biscuits cool; prepare the icing. In a large bowl; mix the royal icing sugar with enough water to make a thick icing. Divide the icing into as many bowls as the number of colours you’d like to use (you’ll need to colour 1 batch black for the mouth) then use the food colouring to colour each a vivid shade - a tiny drop of the food colouring paste goes a long way; so start with a little; then add more if you like. If the icing is too thick to pipe; add a drop more water. Transfer each colour to a separate disposable piping bag and secure the ends (clothes pegs do a good job of keeping the ends closed.)
Break off 50g of the sugarpaste and set the rest aside; wrapped in clingfilm (This will prevent it from drying out and cracking.) Use the red food colouring to dye the small lump of sugarpaste red; kneading until evenly coloured. To make the roses; take hazelnut-sized balls of the red sugarpaste; and press them into long slim oval shapes on the work surface (roughly 1cm x 4 cm; use a little icing sugar on the surface if it gets too sticky.) Roll up the sugarpaste from one end to create a rose. Whilst still on its side; cut off the bottom to give you a flat base. Continue with the rest of the red sugarpaste until you have about 20 roses (enough for 4 biscuits.)
Clean down the surface; and dust with a little extra icing sugar. Roll out the remaining sugarpaste to the thickness of a 50p piece; then cut out as many skull shapes as you have biscuits. Use a little of one of the coloured icings to stick the sugarpaste skulls to the biscuits.
Scrunch any sugarpaste scraps back together and dye the ball of sugarpaste black with the black food colouring; kneading until you have an even colour. Roll out the black sugarpaste and stamp out circles for the eyes (use a round cutter; or the end of a piping nozzle.) Stick the eyes and roses to the biscuits with a little of the coloured royal icing. Snip off the corner of all the piping bags to make a tiny opening and decorate the biscuits as you wish – flowers; hearts and dotty designs all look good. Leave the biscuits to dry for 1 hr before serving. The decorated biscuits will keep for 3 days in a sealed container.",3,food

12,Turkish pizza with spiced pomegranate beef & feta,7.2,0,0,"Mix the dough following pack instructions (leave about 2 tbsp of the bread mix in the bag for dusting and rolling out later). Knead for 8-10 mins; then coat the dough in oil; place in a large bowl and cover. Leave to rise until doubled in size. The warmer your kitchen is; the faster it will rise; but generally it should take 1-2 hrs.
Heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 (or the highest setting). Sprinkle 2 baking trays with a little of the reserved flour and place in the oven to heat up.
Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan until hot. Add the onions and garlic; and cook for a few mins until softened.

Divide the dough into 6 balls. Sprinkle the remaining flour over a work surface and roll out the dough; each to about 25cm across. Remove the trays from the oven and place 2 pizza bases on each (you’ll need to cook in batches). Spread the remaining tomato purée on each base. Top with the meat mixture; peppers; feta and pine nuts. Cook for 10 mins or until the bases are cooked through and golden brown around the edges.
